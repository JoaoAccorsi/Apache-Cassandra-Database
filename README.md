# Objective

Sample Implementation with Apache Cassandra Databases with AstraDatastax to demonstrate CRUD Operations.  
Cassandra is a NoSQL distributed database, and its documentation can be found in [Cassandra Basics](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/cassandra-basics.html).

## 1. Create your Astra DB instance
DataStax Astra DB simplifies cloud-native application development, and reduces time to install, deploy and scale.

âœ… Register (if needed) and Sign In to [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com): You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`.  <br />
âœ… Choose "Start Free Now" plan, then "Get Started" to work in the free tier.

## 2. Create your Cassandra Database

âœ… In the Astra DB home page, choose Create Database.  <br />
âœ… Fill the Database Name and Keyspace Name.  <br />
âœ… For the region, you can choose any provider with the region closest to you.  <br />
âœ… In Databases tab, you will see your databases in Pending statuses. In around 5 minutes it will be ready as Active.
